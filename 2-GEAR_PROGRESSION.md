=====
The bubble canister is by far the worst for quests.<br>
<sub>it has 75% instant conversion, and instant conversion does not count toward quest pollen.</sub>

If you need a bigger bag, do 1 or 2 riley bee quests. They're easy and give you enough strawberries to buy red's bag, which has 750M capacity.

The order you should unlock gear
-----
1. Diamond Boots (I think that's what theyre called)
2. Bucko Guard
..* Tidal Popper
..* Diamond Mask
4. Bubble Canister

The diamond boots are the easiest, costing only 15m honey.<br>
The bucko guard is the second easiest, costing 200m honey and 150 blue extracts.<br>
The tidal popper and diamond mask are where it gets complicated. If you have a lot of honey before this, get the Tidal Popper first. It will help with quests a <i>lot.</i><br>
The bubble canister should be unlocked last for the reason at the top of this document.
