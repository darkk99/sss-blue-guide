PROGRESSION
=====
The bubble canister is by far the worst for quests.<br>
<sub>it has 75% instant conversion, and instant conversion does not count toward quest pollen.</sub>

If you need a bigger bag, do 1 or 2 riley bee quests. They're easy and give you enough strawberries to buy red's bag, which has 750M capacity.

The order you should unlock gear
-----
1. Diamond Boots (I think that's what theyre called)
2. Bucko Guard
..* Tidal Popper
..* Diamond Mask
4. Bubble Canister

The diamond boots are the easiest, costing only 15m honey.<br>
The bucko guard is the second easiest, costing 200m honey and 150 blue extracts.<br>
The tidal popper and diamond mask are where it gets complicated. If you have a lot of honey before this, get the Tidal Popper first. It will help with quests a <i>lot.</i><br>
The bubble canister should be unlocked last for the reason at the top of this document.

The quests you should do
-----
<details>
  <summary>Tidal Popper</summary>
  Bucko Bee quests are really all you need.<br>
  It'll give you the blueberries and everything for Tidal Popper. <i><b>I<b></i> did Shadow Bear's last quest before this <sub>because its easy and gives 9999 blueberries</sub> but you could do it after.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Diamond Mask</summary>
  1. Black bear - Gives 1 diamond egg on one of the later quests.<br>
  2. Brown bear - Gives 1 diamond egg (23rd quest)<br>
  3. Shadow bear - Last quest gives 3 diamond eggs<br>
  ..* <sub> Sage Journey 10 gives 2 diamond eggs, but requires you to collect 250b of any pollen. do sage journey 9 though and just get it over time if you don't want to do brown bear</sub><br>
