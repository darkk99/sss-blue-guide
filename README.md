PREREQUISITES
=====
Before you begin, you'd be shocked to know you shouldn't already be a blue hive. I would reccommend going Red beforehand (or have at least 10 gifted spicy bees) so that you can actually gain pollen.<br>
Blue is not a good pollenmaker, and the bees of it are not good alone. White relates in the sense that the gifted Vector bee ability is useful.

A warning
-----
If you are reading this because you are a red hive already, and want to go white but need more honey...<br>
Stay as a red hive.<br>
Blue hive is quite expensive in Diamond Eggs, and *at the moment* is NOT worth using as a transition to white.<br>
Diamond Mask needs 5 Diamond Eggs and so does Pop Star, but with those you could invest in a Supreme Star Amulet.<br>
<sub>note: all quests combined (including B.B.M.) only give 13 diamond eggs, which is not enough for the Diamond Mask, Pop Star, and Supreme Star Amulet combined (20 diamond eggs)</sub>

What gear you should have
-----
I started off with 10 gifted spicies and some other stuff, but my gear was the following:
* Petal wand<br>
* Petal belt<br>
* Coconut canister<br>
* Bubble mask (can be replaced with honey)<br>
* 10 Gifted Spicy bees<br>
* 20-ish tadpole bees<br>
  * If you are high on honey, use a full gifted spicy bee hive.<br>





PROGRESSION
=====
The bubble canister is by far the worst for quests.<br>
<sub>it has 75% instant conversion, and instant conversion does not count toward quest pollen.</sub>

If you need a bigger bag, do 1 or 2 riley bee quests. They're easy and give you enough strawberries to buy red's bag, which has 750M capacity.

The order you should unlock gear
-----
1. Diamond Boots (I think that's what theyre called)
2. Bucko Guard
..* Tidal Popper
..* Diamond Mask
4. Bubble Canister

The diamond boots are the easiest, costing only 15m honey.<br>
The bucko guard is the second easiest, costing 200m honey and 150 blue extracts.<br>
The tidal popper and diamond mask are where it gets complicated. If you have a lot of honey before this, get the Tidal Popper first. It will help with quests a <i>lot.</i><br>
The bubble canister should be unlocked last for the reason at the top of this document.

The quests you should do
-----
<details>
    <summary>Tidal Popper</summary>
    Bucko Bee quests are really all you need.<br>
    It'll give you the blueberries and everything for Tidal Popper. <i><b>I</b></i> did Shadow Bear's last quest before this <sub><sub>because its easy and gives <i>9999</i> blueberries</sub></sub> but you could do it after.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Diamond Mask</summary>
 
  1. Black bear - Gives 1 diamond egg on one of the later quests.
  2. Brown bear - Gives 1 diamond egg (23rd quest)
  3. Shadow bear - Last quest gives 3 diamond eggs
  <sub> Sage Journey 10 gives 2 diamond eggs, but requires you to collect 250b of any pollen. do sage journey 9 though and just get it over time if you don't want to do brown bear</sub>
