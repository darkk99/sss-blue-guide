PREREQUISITES
=====
Before you begin, you'd be shocked to know you shouldn't already be a blue hive. I would reccommend going Red beforehand (or have at least 10 gifted spicy bees) so that you can actually gain pollen.<br>
Blue is not a good pollenmaker, and the bees of it are not good alone. White relates in the sense that the gifted Vector bee ability is useful.

A warning
-----
If you are reading this because you are a red hive already, and want to go white but need more honey...<br>
Stay as a red hive.<br>
Blue hive is quite expensive in Diamond Eggs, and *at the moment* is NOT worth using as a transition to white.<br>
Diamond Mask needs 5 Diamond Eggs and so does Pop Star, but with those you could invest in a Supreme Star Amulet.<br>
<sub>note: all quests combined (including B.B.M.) only give 13 diamond eggs, which is not enough for the Diamond Mask, Pop Star, and Supreme Star Amulet combined (20 diamond eggs)</sub>

What gear you should have
-----
<details>
<summary> I started off with 10 gifted spicies and some other stuff, but my gear was the following: </summary>
* Petal wand<br>
* Petal belt<br>
* Coconut canister<br>
* Bubble mask (can be replaced with honey)<br>
* 10 Gifted Spicy bees<br>
* 20-ish tadpole bees<br>
  * If you are high on honey, use a full gifted spicy bee hive.<br>
