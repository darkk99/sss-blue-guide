# PREREQUISITES
Before you begin, you'd be shocked to know you shouldn't already be a blue hive. I would reccomend going Red beforehand (or have at least 10 gifted spicy bees) so that you can actually gain pollen.
Blue is not a good pollenmaker, and the bees of it are not good alone. White relates in the sense that the gifted Vector bee ability is useful.

## A warning
If you are reading this because you are a red hive already, and want to go white but need more honey...

Stay as a red hive.

Blue hive is quite expensive in Diamond Eggs, and *at the moment* is NOT worth using as a transition to white.

Diamond Mask needs 5 Diamond Eggs and so does Pop Star, but with those you could invest in a Supreme Star Amulet.

<sub>note: all quests combined (including B.B.M.) only give 13 diamond eggs, which is not enough for the Diamond Mask, Pop Star, and Supreme Star Amulet combined (20 diamond eggs)</sub>
